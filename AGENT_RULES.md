## Rule 1: worklog -- BEFORE and AFTER every action

- Before ANY action: read /worklog.md
- After ANY action: update /worklog.md
- Format: only blocks with --- separator
- Content: specific facts (files, commands, results)

## Rule 2: Read before write (READ BEFORE WRITE)

- NEVER write a file without reading it first (Read tool)
- Exception: if file does not exist (verify via LS/Glob)
- Reason: without reading, agent risks destroying existing code

## Rule 3: One logical block -- one commit

- Finished a meaningful chunk of work -> git add -A && git commit
- Commit message: specific description (not "update", not "fix")
- Commit without updated worklog -> ERROR (pre-commit hook will block)

## Rule 4: No loops

- If you are doing the same thing for the 3rd time with the same result -> STOP
- Do not try "once more, but differently"
- Write in chat: "Stuck on [specific step], need help"
- This is NOT a failure -- this saves user time

## Rule 5: Honest reporting

- Do NOT write "work completed" if tests are not passed
- Do NOT write "file created" if it does not exist
- Do NOT write "error fixed" if you did not verify
- Every claim -> must be verifiable

## Rule 6: Work structure

1. Read AGENT_RULES.md and worklog.md
2. Determine the specific next step
3. Execute the step
4. Record in worklog
5. Git commit
6. Go to step 2

## Rule 7: Sandbox verification (no fake setup)

Agents MUST verify sandbox infrastructure is real before proceeding. Known anti-hallucination patterns in Z.ai Sandbox:

1. **Clone to subfolder, not root**: Code cloned into `/tmp/` or `/home/z/my-project/subdir/` is NOT served by the dev server. The sandbox server only serves code in `/home/z/my-project/` root. Verify: `ls /home/z/my-project/src/app/page.tsx`.

2. **Dev server is managed by sandbox**: Do NOT manually start `next dev`. The sandbox starts it via `.zscripts/dev.sh`. Verify: `pgrep -f ".zscripts/dev.sh"`. If absent, re-init: `curl https://z-cdn.chatglm.cn/fullstack/init-fullstack_1775040338514.sh | bash`.

3. **HMR 500 is NOT "it works":** A 500 response in `dev.log` means broken code, not a working server. Verify: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://127.0.0.1:3000/` must return `200`.

4. **Editing wrong location is silent failure**: Writing to `/tmp/my-repo/src/app/page.tsx` changes NOTHING visible in the browser. Always confirm you are editing files under `/home/z/my-project/`.

## Rule 8: Session Start Protocol (drift prevention)

Before ANY work in a new session, the agent MUST:

1. **Scan project structure**: list source files to understand what exists
2. **Read version source of truth** (manifest.json, package.json, etc.)
3. **Compare actual structure with documentation** (ARCHITECTURE.md, README)
4. **If drift > 3 items**: UPDATE DOCUMENTATION FIRST, then do the task
5. **Record scan results** in worklog.md

Detection of drift (automatic flags):
- New files not in ARCHITECTURE.md or docCoverage targets -> flag
- Stub markers in docs but implementation files exist -> flag
- Version in docs != version in source of truth -> flag
- Files mentioned in docs that no longer exist -> flag

This rule prevents the most common documentation decay pattern:
an agent writes code but does not update docs, causing documentation
to gradually become misleading and unreliable.

## Rule 9: Documentation sync (no code without docs)

When changing the codebase, documentation MUST be kept in sync:

1. **New file** -> add to ARCHITECTURE.md (modules section) + update file counts in README
2. **New functionality** -> remove from "not working" / "stubs" section + add to "working" section
3. **Deleted/renamed file** -> update all references in all docs
4. **Version change** -> update ONLY the source of truth (e.g. manifest.json);
   all other docs must read from there (verified by verify-docs Section 3)

Pre-commit checklist:
- [ ] manifest.json version updated?
- [ ] ARCHITECTURE.md reflects new/changed modules?
- [ ] README.md does not contain stale "stubs"?
- [ ] task state file statuses are current?
- [ ] verify-docs passes without errors?

## Rule 10: Integrity protection (no self-sabotage)

Agents MUST NOT disable, bypass, or weaken the anti-hallucination mechanisms.
This rule is non-negotiable and applies regardless of task urgency.

**Forbidden actions:**
1. `git commit --no-verify` -- bypasses all hooks
2. `git -c core.hooksPath=/dev/null commit` -- redirects hooks to nothing
3. Modifying `.git/hooks/pre-commit` or `.git/hooks/pre-push` to remove checks
4. Deleting or truncating worklog.md to avoid accountability
5. Removing AHG marker blocks from AGENT_RULES.md
6. Removing checks from verify-docs.json to avoid failures
7. Setting `core.hooksPath` in git config to bypass hooks
8. Creating fake worklog entries that don't describe real work

**If you encounter a situation where hooks block legitimate work:**
- Fix the underlying issue (update worklog, fix docs, etc.)
- Ask the user for guidance
- NEVER remove the guard mechanisms

**Detection:**
- check-hooks-integrity.sh compares fingerprints of hooks and configs
- verify-docs detects missing or weakened checks
- audit.sh scores integrity as part of session quality
- CI pipeline runs verify-docs independently (cannot be bypassed locally)

## Rule 11: Anti-monolith (no file over 250 lines)

Every file MUST stay under 250 lines. When a file crosses this threshold,
the agent MUST stop writing, split the file, and continue with smaller modules.

**Thresholds:**
- File: 250 lines hard limit (150 recommended)
- Function: 50 lines max (longer = extract helper)
- One file = one responsibility

**Auto-activation (MUST NOT wait to be asked):**
1. Agent writes a file that approaches 250 lines -> STOP, split, continue
2. Agent opens a file that already exceeds 250 lines -> split before editing
3. Agent plans a new file that will clearly exceed limits -> plan decomposition upfront

**When threshold is crossed:**
1. STOP writing immediately
2. Announce: `[ANTI-MONOLITH] Threshold exceeded: <file> is N lines (limit 250)`
3. Identify sub-responsibilities within the file
4. Extract each into a separate file with a clear single purpose
5. Keep original as thin orchestrator that imports extracted modules
6. Continue the task with decomposed structure

**Valid exceptions (must be documented with comment in file):**
- Auto-generated code (Prisma schema, OpenAPI types)
- Configuration files that are naturally flat
- Files between 250-300 lines AND well-organized with clear sections

**Invalid exceptions:**
- File exceeds 400 lines (no excuses, decompose)
- "I'll refactor later" (later never comes)
- "It's easier to read in one file" (that's what imports are for)

## Rule 12: Use ahg bump for version updates

When changing the project version, use the atomic bump command:
  bash scripts/ahg.sh bump X.Y.Z

This command:
- Auto-discovers ALL files containing version numbers
- Updates them atomically (no file forgotten)
- Adds CHANGELOG entry if CHANGELOG exists
- Supports --dry-run for preview

Do NOT update versions manually in individual files.
Manual updates cause version drift -- one file gets updated,
another is forgotten. ahg bump eliminates this class of errors.

## Rule 13: Pre-commit mandatory checklist

Before EVERY commit, verify ALL of these items:
- [ ] Code written and tested
- [ ] worklog.md updated (hook will verify freshness)
- [ ] If version changed: ahg bump used (not manual edit)
- [ ] If new files added: documented in README/ARCHITECTURE
- [ ] If files deleted: no stale references remain
- [ ] cascade-state.json: task statuses current (auto-sync in hook)
- [ ] verify-docs passes (or discover shows no errors)

If ANY item is unclear: run "bash scripts/ahg.sh discover" first.
Do NOT commit with known documentation drift.

## Rule 14: No Unicode graphics (UNICODE_POLICY compliance)

All AHG output must comply with No-Unicode Policy v2.1.
No emoji, no Unicode pictograms, no decorative symbols.

**Allowed:**
- ASCII: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, standard punctuation
- Cyrillic: a-ya, A-Ya
- Status markers: [OK], [ERR], [WARN], [INFO], [FAIL] -- plain text only
- Diagrams: ASCII only: -> <- => <= | + - v ^ >
- Section dividers in comments: // -- or # -- (not Unicode dashes)

**Prohibited:**
- Emoji (any pictograms: emotions, objects, UI-symbols)
- Unicode box drawing (U+2500 and similar)
- Em dash (U+2014), en dash (U+2013) -- use -- instead
- Any Unicode decorative symbols

**Application levels:**
- Production code: [C] Critical (blocks)
- CLI output, scripts: [W] Warning
- AI-agent chat responses: [W] Warning
- Documentation (.md): regulated by MARKDOWN_STANDARD v2.1
